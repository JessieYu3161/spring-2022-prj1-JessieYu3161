### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Project title: LOVER OF WISDOM
+ This project is conducted by Jessie Yu.

+ Project summary: Dive into the lovers of wisdom! In this analysis, it presents word clouds of 13 Philosophical schools, and sentiment analysis based on each school and each author that within. More specifically, I intend to get a sense of the word choice in terms of sentiment types of each philosophers and how are they similar or different to each other, both individually and by school.
